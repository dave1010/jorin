# Jorin AGENTS.md

this is the Jorin coding agent golang repo.

check README.md for full build instructions.

if you change code then check it's ok with:

```bash
make fmt
make test
make lint
```

build with

```bash
make
```

code base needs to be refactored and tests added as you go. code quality needs to _improve_ with changes and complexity must be managed.

keep docs up to date, eg README.md and CHANGELOG.md.
